# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe (Python Console Game)

This was a simple, two-player Tic Tac Toe game played in the terminal but was updated to a graphic user interface (GUI) in second commit.  
The game is built using Python, tkinter and NumPy, using a 3×3 board represented by a 2D array.  
It features turn-based play, win detection (rows, columns, diagonals), and draw detection.

## ✅ Features

- Display a Beautiful and clean GUI to enjoy real gaming experience
- 2D NumPy array used for the board
- Players represented by "X" and "O"
- Detects wins in rows, columns, and both diagonals
- Prevents overwriting cells

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (For providing Graphic User interface)
- NumPy (for 2D array handling)

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe.py

2. Players take turns by clicking on the box/cell they want.

3. The game board updates after each move.

4. First player to align three symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

5. If the board fills without a winner, it's a draw.


Current Board:

 X |  O  | 
 
---+---+---

   |  X | 
   
---+---+---

 O  |   | X
 

🎉 Player X won the match. Congratulation!

- Add a scoring system to track wins over multiple rounds  
- Implement a GUI version using Tkinter or PyGame (Upgraded in second commit)  
- Add sound effects and animations for better UX  
- Make the board size dynamic (e.g. 4x4 or 5x5 support)

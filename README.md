# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe (Python Console Game)

This is a simple, two-player Tic Tac Toe game played in the terminal.  
The game is built using Python and NumPy, using a 3×3 board represented by a 2D array.  
It features turn-based play, win detection (rows, columns, diagonals), and draw detection.

---

## ✅ Features

- 2D NumPy array used for the board
- Players represented by "X" and "O"
- Detects wins in rows, columns, and both diagonals
- Prevents overwriting cells
- Clear console display after each move

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy (for 2D array handling)

---

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe.py

2. Players take turns entering their move as row and column numbers (1–3).

3. The game board updates after each move.

4. First player to align three symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

5. If the board fills without a winner, it's a draw.


Current Board:

 X |  O  | 
 
---+---+---

    | X | 
   
---+---+---

 O  |    | X
 

🎉 Player X won the match. Congratulation!

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add a single-player mode with AI opponent (Minimax algorithm)  
- Add a scoring system to track wins over multiple rounds  
- Implement a GUI version using Tkinter or PyGame  
- Add sound effects and animations for better UX  
- Make the board size dynamic (e.g. 4x4 or 5x5 support)
